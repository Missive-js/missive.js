With Missive.js, an _intent_ is either a `command`, a `query`, or an `event` and it is created using the specialized bus.
Usually you will have 3 different buses:

-   **Query Bus**: For read-only operations that retrieve data.
-   **Command Bus**: For operations that mutate application state.
-   **Event Bus**: For broadcasting changes and triggering asynchronous actions.

Here's how it works:

<Steps>
1. You begin by creating an _intent_. This could be a `command` (e.g., to create a new user), a query (e.g., to fetch product details), or an event (e.g., an order being placed).
   At the point of creation, the _intent_ is validated to ensure it has the correct structure and necessary parameters, meeting all predefined requirements.

2. Once returned (or later in the lifecycle of your application), you dispatch the intent to the bus.

3. On dispatch, the bus wraps the _intent_ in an Envelope.

4. The Envelope then flows through the series of configured middleware functions. These middleware can:

    - log relevant information for monitoring
    - apply additional business logic or validations as needed
    - attach Stamps to the Envelope. Stamps serve as markers influencing how the intent is processed.
    - observe the result of the `command` and dispatch events based on the outcome.

5. Finally, the Envelope reaches the handler defined for the Intent. The handler processes the intent based on the information and stamps within the Envelope, and returns the result,
   which could be data, a confirmation, or any other type of response.

</Steps>
This structured pipeline ensures that intents are processed in a controlled and consistent manner, allowing for flexibility in adding features like logging, validation, and custom behavior, 
all while keeping the core business logic clean and maintainable.

Here is a diagram to illustrate the flow of an intent through Missive.js:
