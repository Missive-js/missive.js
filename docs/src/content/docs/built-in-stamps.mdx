This page lists all the built-in Stamps that Missive.js provides. 
Stamps are a way to handle cross-cutting concerns in your application. They are key to keeping your code clean and maintainable. 
Most of all, they are easy to write and use, and they can be generic!

## Added by the Bus

### IdentityStamp

```typescript
type AsyncStamp = Stamp<undefined, 'missive:async'>;
```
Added on `bus.dispatch(intent|envelope)`.

<Aside title="Dispatching an envelope" type="note">
If an `envelope` is dispatched, the original `IdentityStamp` will be preserved.
</Aside>

### HandledStamp

```typescript
type HandledStamp<R> = Stamp<R, 'missive:handled'>;
```
Added when the intent is handled by the handler.

<Aside title="More than one handler" type="tip">
The `HandledStamp` will be added by each handler.
</Aside>

<Aside title="Conditional handling" type="caution">
If a Middleware adds this stamp, the bus will not run the handler.
</Aside>


### ReprocessedStamp

```typescript
type ReprocessedStamp = Stamp<{ stamps: Stamp[] }, 'missive:reprocessed'>;
```

Added when an `envelope` is dispatched through the bus instead of an `intent`.
> The bus will save the original `stamps` in the `ReprocessedStamp` stamp.

This happens with 2 built-in middlewares:

-  Using the [Async middleware](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/async) in a consumer, you will get a `ReprocessedStamp` because you should dispatch the `envelope` instead of the `intent`.
-  Using the [Cacher middleware](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/cacher) you will get a `ReprocessedStamp` because the middleware will redispatch the `envelope` to the `queryBus` for _Stale While Revalidating_ purposes.


## Added by the Middlewares

### AsyncStamp

```typescript
type AsyncStamp = Stamp<undefined, 'missive:async'>;
```

Added when the envelope is sent to a queue via the [Async middleware](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/async).

### FromCacheStamp

```typescript
type FromCacheStamp = Stamp<{ age: number; stale: boolean }, 'missive:cache:hit'>;
```

Added when the [Cacher middleware](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/cacher) finds the result in the cache.


### CacheableStamp

```typescript
export type CacheableStamp = Stamp<{ ttl?: number; staleTtl?: number }, 'missive:cacheable'>;
```
That you can add in your handler to have cache on demand. See [Cacher middleware](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/cacher).


### FeatureFlagFallbackStamp

```typescript
type FeatureFlagFallbackStamp = Stamp<undefined, 'missive:feature-flag-fallback'>;
```

When the [Feature Flag Middleware](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/feature-flag) uses a fallbackHandler.

### TimingsStamp

 ```typescript
type TimingsStamp = Stamp<{ total: number }, 'missive:timings'>
```

Add by the [Logger middleware](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/logger) when the message is handled or errored with the total time elapsed in nanoseconds.

### RetriedStamp

```typescript
type RetriedStamp = Stamp<{ attempt: number; errorMessage: string }, 'missive:retried'>;
```

Added by the [Retryer middleware](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/retryer) when the middleware retries the handling of the intent.
<Aside title="More than one retry" type="tip">
You will get more than one Stamp!
</Aside>


### WebhookCalledStamp
    
```typescript
type WebhookCalledStamp = Stamp<{ attempt: number; text?: string, status?: number }, 'missive:webhook-called'>;
```

Add by the [Webhook middleware](/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/webhook) when the middleware succeed to call the webhook(s) or ultimately at the end of the retries.
