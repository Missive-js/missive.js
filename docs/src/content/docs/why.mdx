As a developer, whether you primarily work on the backend using frameworks like NestJS, Express, Koa, or Fastify, where your focus is
solely on backend services, or you focus on frontend development with modern tools like Next.js, Remix, or Astro that integrate backend
functionality through Backend for Frontend (BFF) patterns, you often need to build and manage server-side code.

For pure backend applications, maintaining clarity and structure as your codebase grows can be challenging. Business logic, API handling,
and middleware can become intertwined, leading to complex, tightly coupled systems that are difficult to scale and maintain. On the other
hand, for frontend frameworks that incorporate backend logic (BFF), frontend and backend concerns can intermingle, further complicating the
separation of responsibilities and maintainability.

Missive.js offers a solution by bringing the principles of CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Clean Architecture into your
projects, whether you are building standalone backend services, frontend applications with backend capabilities, or bridging both. Missive.js
helps you build modular, maintainable, and scalable systems that cleanly separate concerns and promote best practices.

## Problem that it solves

Traditional approaches to building backend logic, whether as standalone services or within frontend-integrated frameworks (BFF), often suffer from:

-   **Tightly coupled code**: Business logic, API routes, and middleware are often tightly bound together, making it difficult to introduce changes or
    extensions without affecting multiple parts of the application.
-   **Difficult scaling**: As applications grow, monolithic codebases become harder to manage, leading to more bugs and slower development cycles.
-   **Lack of modularity**: Reusing components or logic becomes challenging, especially when different parts of your application need to interact
    in a loosely coupled manner.
-   **Observability and debugging**: Understanding how data flows through your system, tracking errors, and monitoring performance can be challenging
    without clear separation of concerns.

## How it helps

Missive.js addresses these challenges by introducing a Service Bus pattern inspired by CQRS and Clean Architecture principles. It provides a
centralized system for handling Commands, Queries, and Events, allowing you to build modular and decoupled components that are easy to manage and scale.

1. **Separation of concerns**: Missive.js helps you clearly separate different types of operations:

-   **Commands**: Actions that mutate(change) the state of your application, such as creating a new user or updating a profile.
-   **Queries**: Requests for information that do not alter the state, like fetching user data or retrieving a list of products.
-   **Events**: Notifications about state changes that can be handled in an asynchronous manner, useful for integrating with other systems or services.

2. **Middleware system**: Missive.js includes a powerful middleware system that allows you to inject cross-cutting concerns, such as:

-   **Logging**: Consistent logging across all operations, providing centralized insight into your application's behavior.
-   **Validation**: Reusable validation logic that ensures all incoming data adheres to your application's requirements before it reaches the handlers.
-   **Authorization**: Easy-to-implement access control checks that run before commands or queries are processed.

This middleware architecture is familiar if you've used libraries like Express, Fastify, Koa, etc. making it intuitive for both backend and frontend developers.
It centralizes the processing logic, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.

## How does it work?

### Example

<Steps>

1.  Create the Command bus

    ```typescript
    type CommandHandlerRegistry = SendRegistrationEmailDefinition & SendNotificationDefinition;
    const bus = createCommandBus<CommandHandlerRegistry>();

    bus.register('sendRegistrationEmail', Schema, Factory({ mailer }));
    ```

2.  Dispatch an intent
    ```typescript
    const intent = bus.createCommand('sendRegistrationEmail', { email: 'plopix@example.com' });
    // ...
    const { envelope, result } = await bus.dispatch(intent);
    ```

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip" title="Why can't I inject the intent directly into the handler?">
_Why should you use a service bus in the first place?!_

```typescript
const command = { userId: 'xyx' };
const result = await removeUser(command, deps);
```

> It seems way simpler!

This is a common question, and the answer lies in the benefits of using a Service Bus to promote decoupling and a clear separation of concerns.

-   **Centralized control**: By routing all `commands`, `queries`, and `events` through a centralized bus, you gain a consistent point of control.
    This allows you to easily implement global concerns like logging, validation, or error handling in a single place rather than duplicating
    logic across multiple handlers. See it likes an http server that routes requests to the right handler.

-   **Decoupling of _intent_ and execution**: Sending an intent (e.g., a command or query) through a service bus decouples the sender from the handler.
    This means the sender does not need to know which handler processes the intent or how it's executed, allowing for more flexibility and easier changes.
    This decoupling is crucial for scaling your application as new features are added, or existing ones are modified.

-   **Support for Advanced Patterns**: A service bus allows you to implement more advanced architectural patterns like:
    -   _Saga Orchestration_: Managing distributed transactions and workflows by coordinating multiple services or operations through a central mechanism.
    -   _Message Replay_: Replaying past events to rebuild state or debug issues.
        \_ _Retry Policies_: Implementing automatic retries for operations that might fail due to transient issues, improving the resilience of your application.
