## Installation

Like any other package, you can install Missive.js using _npm_, _yarn_ or _pnpm_.

<Install />

## Ubiquitous language

- **Intent**: This is what you want to send to the bus. It can be a `command`, a `query` or an `event`.
- **Envelope**: It gives full flexibility inside the service bus, by wrapping the messages into it, allowing to add useful information inside through envelope stamps.
- **Stamps**: Piece of information you need to attach to an Envelope, can be any sort of metadata your middleware / handler may use.

## Create your first handler

Here we are going to create an handler aside its definitions.

<CreateHandler />

<Aside title="Understand this code" variant='note'>
Only 3 things are going to change in your code. `Type`, `handler` and `Schema`. The following lines are a boilerplate code that you can copy-paste for a Command.
```typescript
type Deps = {/* your dependencies here */};

type Command = {/* your command type here */};
type Result = Awaited<ReturnType<typeof handler>>;
export type Definition = CommandHandlerDefinition<'createUser', Command, Result>;

const handler = async (envelope: Envelope<Command>, deps: Deps) => {
    /* your handler code here */
};

export const Factory = (deps: Deps) => (query: Envelope<Command>) => handler(query, deps);
```

## Define your bus(es)

Once you have your handler(s) ready, you can create your bus(es) and register your handler(s).

<CreateBus />

> More examples are available [on Github](https://github.com/missive-js/missive.js/blob/main/examples/shared/src/core/buses.server.ts).

## Dispatch an intent

From there you can use the preferred approach to inject the bus(es) in your application and dispatch an intent.

<Disptach />

Enjoy fully typed code and a clean architecture!

## Added Stamps

The Bus is going to add some Stamps to the Envelope, here is the list:

    -     
        ```typescript
        export type IdentityStamp = Stamp<{ id: string }, 'missive:identity'>;
        ```
        > To identify an Envelope
    -     
        ```typescript
        export type HandledStamp<R> = Stamp<R, 'missive:handled'>;
        ```
        > To includes the result(s) of the handler(s)
