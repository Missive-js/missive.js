The Webhook Middleware is built-in middleware that gives you capability to send the envelope to webhook(s).

## How to use it

As for any Middleware, you can use it by adding it to the `bus` instance.

```typescript
const commandBus = createCommandBus<CommandHandlerRegistry>();
commandBus.useWebhookMiddleware({
    async: true,
    parallel: true,
    maxAttempts: 3,
    jitter: 0.5,
    multiplier: 1.5,
    waitingAlgorithm: 'exponential',
    fetcher: fetch,
    intents: {
        createUser: {
            async: false,
            parallel: false,
            jitter: 0.25,
            endpoints: [
                {
                    url: 'https://webhook.site/c351ab7a-c4cc-4270-9872-48a2d4f67ea4',
                    method: 'POST',
                    headers: {
                        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                    },
                    signatureHeader: 'X-Plop-Signature',
                    signature: (payload) => 'signature',
                },
            ],
        },
    },
});
```

### Explanation

The Webhook middleware is simply taking the envelope and send it to the confifured Webhooks. 
It includes a retry mechanism in case of failure, between each attempt, the middleware is going to wait for a certain amount of time. 
The `waitingAlgorithm` can be `exponential`, `fibonacci`, or `none`.

- `jitter` is a value between 0 and 1 that will add some randomness to the waiting time.
- `multiplier` is the factor to multiply the waiting time between each attempt. (only used for `exponential`)

<Aside title="Async mode" type="caution">
If set in `async` mode, the middleware will not wait for the webhook to respond before continuing the processing, therefore it won't add Stamps.
</Aside>

## Added Stamps 

The Webhook Middleware is going to add:

    -     
        ```typescript
        type WebhookCalledStamp = Stamp<{ attempt: number; text?: string, status?: number }, 'missive:webhook-called'>;
        ```
        > Every time the middleware succeed to call the webhook or ultimately at the end of the retries.
