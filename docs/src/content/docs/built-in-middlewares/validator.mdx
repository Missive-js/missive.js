The Validator Middleware is built-in middleware that gives you capability to validate the intent before it's handled.

You can use any library (such as [Zod](https://zod.dev), [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi), [ajv](https://ajv.js.org/)...) you want to validate the intent, as long as it returns a boolean.

## How to use it

As for any Middleware, you can use it by adding it to the `bus` instance.

Then for each intent you want to validate, you provide a function that will return `true` if the intent is valid, `false` otherwise.
If you provide a function that returns `false`, the middleware will throw an `Error`.

If you don't provide a function for an intent, the middleware will assume the intent is valid and won't validate it.

```typescript
const queryBus = createQueryBus<QueryHandlerRegistry>();
queryBus.useValidatorMiddleware({
    myIntent: myFunctionThatValidateTheIntent
});
```

Here is an example using the [Zod](https://zod.dev) library:

```typescript
const createUserSchema = z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    email: z.string().email(),
});

queryBus.useValidatorMiddleware({ 
    createUser: (message) => createUserSchema.safeParse(message).success 
});
```

## Added Stamps 

The Validator Middleware is not adding any stamps.
