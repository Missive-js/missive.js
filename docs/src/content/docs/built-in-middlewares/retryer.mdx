The Retryer Middleware is built-in middleware that gives you capability to retry the handling of an intent.

## How to use it

As for any Middleware, you can use it by adding it to the `bus` instance.

```typescript
const commandBus = createCommandBus<CommandHandlerRegistry>();
commandBus.useRetryerMiddleware({
    maxAttempts: 5;
    waitingAlgorithm: 'exponential',
    multiplier: 1.5;
    jitter: 0.5;
});
```

> Remember built-in middlewares are _intent_ aware, therefore you can customize the behavior per intent using the key `intents`.

### Explanation

The Retryer middleware is going to catch the execution and re-run the following middleware until the `maxAttempts` is reached.
Between each attempt, the middleware is going to wait for a certain amount of time. 
The `waitingAlgorithm` can be `exponential`, `fibonacci`, or `none`.

- `jitter` is a value between 0 and 1 that will add some randomness to the waiting time.
- `multiplier` is the factor to multiply the waiting time between each attempt. (only used for `exponential`)

> Internally, the retryer middleware will keep a registry of _sleeper_ if you decide to have different configuration per intent.

<Aside title="Error Stamps" type="caution">
Retryer Middleware will also retry the handling of the intent if it finds more `error` stamps than before.
Some handlers might not throw exceptions but add `error` stamps to the result. A good example would be a lock middleware that would
add an `error` stamp if the lock is not acquired.
</Aside>

## Added Stamps 

The Retryer Middleware is going to add:

    -     
        ```typescript
        type RetriedStamp = Stamp<{ attempt: number; errorMessage: string }, 'missive:retried'>;
        ```
        > Every time the middleware retries the handling of the intent.
