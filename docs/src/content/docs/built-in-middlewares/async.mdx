The Async Middleware is built-in middleware that gives you capability to defer the handling to an consumer to achieve real asynchronousity.
It's only available for _CommandBus_ and _EventBus_

## How to use it

As for any Middleware, you can use it by adding it to the `bus` instance.

```typescript
const commandBus = createCommandBus<CommandHandlerRegistry>();
commandBus.useAsyncMiddleware({
    consume: false, // KEY POINT
    produce: async (envelope) => {
        // use your favorite queue system here
        console.log('Generic Push to Queue', envelope);
    },
    async: true,// default is true
    intents: {
        createUser: {
            async: true,
            produce: async (envelope) => {
                // use your favorite queue system here
                console.log('createUser Push to Queue', envelope);
            },
        },
    },
});
```

> Remember built-in middlewares are _intent_ aware, therefore you can customize the behavior per intent using the key `intents`.

Next, you need to have a consumer that will consume it. The way to do that with Missive.js is to create another bus with this middlware with `consume: true`.

```typescript
commandBus.useAsyncMiddleware({
    consume: true, // KEY POINT
});
```

The worker script that consumes the queue can dispatch the message it receives directly to the dispatch method:

```typescript
// Consumer script
onMessage: async (message) => {
    const envelope = JSON.parse(message);
    await commandBus.dispatch(intent);
}
```
<Aside title="Gotchas" type="note">
Generally, the `dispatch` receives an `intent` but it can also receive an `envelope`. In this case, the `envelope` is the message received from the queue.
</Aside>

### Explanation

The flow is the following:

<Steps>

1. Your application (web node for instance) will have a bus on which this middleware is added with `consume: false`. 

2. When you dispatch an intent, the middleware will push the intent to the queue system (via the `produce` method that you provide) instead of handling it.

3. You have another application (worker node for instance) that will have a bus on which this middleware is added with `consume: true`.

4. This worker will consume the intent from the queue system and handle it.

</Steps>

<Aside title="Important things to remember" type="caution">
- `intent` will pass through the bus twice, once for the `produce` and once for the `consume`, so make sure your middleware have no side effects.
- Async Middleware breaks sthe chain of middlewares and for this reason, it is usually register the last.
</Aside>

<Aside title="Gotchas" type="tip">
When you dispatch an `envelope` to the `bus`, the bus will save the `envelope` original `stamps` in the `ReprocessedStamp` stamp.
This way, the bus that consumes the `envelope` can have access to the original `stamps`.
</Aside>


## Added Stamps 

The Async Middleware is going to add:

    -     
        ```typescript
        type AsyncStamp = Stamp<undefined, 'missive:async'>;
        ```
        > When the intent is pushed to the queue.

    -     
        ```typescript
        type ReprocessedStamp = Stamp<{ stamps: Stamp[] }, 'missive:reprocessed'>;
        ```
        > When the envelope is dispatched.
