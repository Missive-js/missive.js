The Cacher Middleware is built-in middleware that gives you capability to cache the results of queries. To speed up your application.
It's only available for _QueryBus_

## How to use it

As for any Middleware, you can use it by adding it to the `bus` instance.

```typescript
const queryBus = createQueryBus<QueryHandlerRegistry>();
queryBus.useCacherMiddleware({
    adapter,
    cache: 'all',
    defaultTtl: 300
})
```

> Remember built-in middlewares are _intent_ aware, therefore you can customize the behavior per intent using the key `intents`.

Of course, the key is in the `adapter` that you will provide to the `createCacherMiddleware` function. 
This adapter must respect the `CacherAdapter` interface.

Here is an example: 

```typescript
const createMemoryCacheAdapter = (): CacherAdapter => {
    const memory = new Map<string, { value: unknown; expiresAt: number }>();
    return {
        get: async (key) => {
            const entry = memory.get(key);
            if (entry && Date.now() < entry.expiresAt) {
                return entry.value;
            }
            memory.delete(key);
            return null;
        },
        set: async (key: string, value, ttl) => {
            const expiresAt = Date.now() + ttl * 1000;
            memory.set(key, { value, expiresAt });
        },
    };
};
const adapter = createMemoryCache();
```
<Aside title="We got you cover!" type="tip">
Do not copy/paste this boilerplate, if `adapter` is not passed to the `createCacherMiddleware` function,
it will default to `memoryCache` and provide you with the basic cacher above.
</Aside>

### Explanation

With the Cacher Middleware, if the intent result is already in the cache, it will be returned directly without
calling the handler.

Aside of the `adapter`, you can provide the following parameters to the `createCacherMiddleware` function (and per `intents`):
- **cache**: `all` or `only-cacheable` (default: `all`) - `all` will cache all results
- **defaultTtl**: number (default: `3600`) - the default time to live in seconds

### Cache on demand

If you want to control the cacheable state from the handler (or another middleware), you can pass the option `cache` equals to `only-cacheable`. (globally or per intent)
Then you need to tell the Middleware which queries are cacheable by adding the `cacheable` stamp to the result. 

```typescript
const handler = async (envelope: Envelope<Query>, deps: Deps) => {
    // your handler code here
    envelope.addStamp<CacheableStamp>('missive:cacheable', { ttl: 1800 });
    return {
        // your result here
    }
};
```

## Added Stamps 

The Cacher Middleware is going to add:

    -     
        ```typescript
        type FromCacheStamp = Stamp<undefined, 'missive:cache:hit'>;
        ```
        > When the result is coming from cache.

    -    
        ```typescript
        export type HandledStamp<R> = Stamp<R, 'missive:handled'>;
        ```
        > With the result from the cache.  


## Shortcircuiting the processing

As explain the [Middleware guide](/missive.js/guides/middlewares#breaking-the-chain-of-middlewares), you can shortcircuit the processing by _NOT_ calling `next()` in a middleware.

This is exactly what the CacherMiddleware does. It does not call `next()` which means that all the middlewares after it will be skipped. 

You can change this behavior by providing the `shortCircuit` flag to `false`.

```typescript
    queryBus.useCacherMiddleware({
        adapter: memoryStorage,
        shortCircuit: false, // default is true
        defaultTtl: 20,
        intents: {
            ListAllCharacters: { shortCircuit: true }, // this intent will skip all the middlewares after Cacher
        },
    });
```

<Aside title="Handling won't happen twice!" type="note">
Shortcircuiting has no impact on the "handling". As CacherMiddleware is adding the `HandledStamp` the bus won't call the handler anyway when the result is coming from the cache.
The only impact of this flag is wether or not the next middlewares are called or not.
</Aside>

> **With great power comes great responsibility.** - Missive.js is not opinionated, it's up to you to decide what is best for your application.

<Aside title="Why do we default to `shortCircuit: true`" type="tip">
We believe this is the expected behavior, and as subsequent middlewares might have side-effects, we prefer to skip them in those scenarios. (but you do you!)
