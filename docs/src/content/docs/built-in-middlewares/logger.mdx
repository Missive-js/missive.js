The Logger Middleware is built-in middleware that gives you capability to add observability to your application by logging:
- the intent (`query`, `command` or `event`) before and once handled (or errored)
- the result(s) of the handler(s)
- the Stamps

## How to use it

As for any Middleware, you can use it by adding it to the `bus` instance.

```typescript
const loggerMiddleware = createLoggerMiddleware({logger, adapter});
const queryBus = createQueryBus<QueryHandlerRegistry>();
queryBus.use(loggerMiddleware);
```

Of course, the key is in the `adapter` that you can provide to the `createLoggerMiddleware` function. 
This adapter must respect the `LoggerAdapter` interface.

> Logger must respect _LoggerInterface_ which is `log(...args: unknow[]): void` and `error(...args: unknow[]): void`

Here is an example: 

```typescript
export const adapter: LoggerAdapter = {
    processing: (identity, message, results, stamps) =>
        logger.log(
            `[Envelope<${identity?.body?.id}>](Processing)`,
            JSON.stringify({
                message,
                results,
                stamps,
            }),
        ),
    processed: (identity, message, results, stamps) => {
        const timings = stamps.filter((stamp) => stamp.type === 'missive:timings')?.[0] as TimingsStamp | undefined;
        logger.log(
            `[Envelope<${identity?.body?.id}>](Processed${timings?.body?.total ? ` in ${(timings.body.total / 1000000).toFixed(4)} ms` : ''})`,
            JSON.stringify({
                message,
                results,
                stamps,
            }),
        );
    },
    error: (identity, message, results, stamps) => {
        const timings = stamps.filter((stamp) => stamp.type === 'missive:timings')?.[0] as TimingsStamp | undefined;
        logger.error(
            `[Envelope<${identity?.body?.id}>](Errored${timings?.body?.total ? ` in ${(timings.body.total / 1000000).toFixed(4)} ms` : ''}`,
            JSON.stringify({
                message,
                results,
                stamps,
            }),
        )
    }
};
```

<Aside title="We got you cover!" type="tip">
Do not copy/paste this boilerplate, if `adapter` is not passed to the `createLoggerMiddleware` function,
it will default to the `console` `logger` and provide you with the basic adapter above.
</Aside>

### Explanation

Internally, the Logger Middleware is going to call that adapter 2 times:
- `processing`: when the message is received
- `processed`: when the message is handled
- `error`: when the message is in error

The parameters for each of those functions are:
- `identity`: A Stamp that contains the `id` of the Envelope
- `message`: The intent that has been dispatched
- `results`: The result(s) of the handler(s)
- `stamps`: The rest of the Stamps. (yes Identify and Results are extracted stamps from the Envelope)

<Aside title="Gotcha!" type="caution">
Those function can be `async`, the middleware will `await` for the promise to be resolved before continuing.
Which means that you can log to a database or any other async operation BUT be careful with the performance.
There are 2 other parameters you can pass to the `createLoggerMiddleware` function:
- `async`: the logger will not `await` for the promises to be resolved
- `collect`: the logger will collect the logs without awaiting during collection, and then `await` or not based on the `async` option.
</Aside>

## Added Stamps 

The Logger Middleware is going to add:

    -     
        ```typescript
        type TimingsStamp = Stamp<{ total: number }, 'missive:timings'>
        ```
        > When the message is handled or errored with the total time elapsed in nanoseconds.
