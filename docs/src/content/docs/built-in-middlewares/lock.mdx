The Lock Middleware is built-in middleware that gives you capability to lock messages.
It's available for _CommandBus_ and _QueryBus_

## How to use it

As for any Middleware, you can use it by adding it to the `bus` instance.

```typescript
const commandBus = createCommandBus<CommandHandlerRegistry>();
commandBus.useLockMiddleware({
        getLockKey: (envelope) => envelope.message.id,
    }, {
        adapter,
        ttl: 500, // the default ttl for all messages
        tick: 100, // the delay between each try to get the lock
        timeout: 1000 // the maximum time to wait for the lock
    }
)
```

> Remember built-in middlewares are _intent_ aware, therefore you can customize the behavior per intent using the key `intents`.

Of course, the key is in the `adapter` that you will provide to the `createLockMiddleware` function.
This adapter must respect the `LockAdapter` interface.

Here is an example:

```typescript
type LockerInfo = {
    expiresAt: number;
};

export const createInMemoryLockAdapter = (): LockAdapter => {
    const store: Map<string, LockerInfo> = new Map();

    return {
        acquire: async (key, ttl) => {
            if (store.has(key)) {
                if (store.get(key)!.expiresAt > Date.now()) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            const now = Date.now();
            const expiresAt = now + ttl;
            store.set(key, { expiresAt });
            return true;
        },
        release: async (key) => {
            store.delete(key);
        },
    };
};

const adapter = createInMemoryLockAdapter();
```
<Aside title="We got you cover!" type="tip">
Do not copy/paste this boilerplate, if `adapter` is not passed to the `createLockMiddleware` function,
it will default to `inMemoryLockAdapter` and provide you with the basic locker above.

Therefore, it is not really recommended to use the default adapter as it is won't be efficient or reliable for multi-node applications.
</Aside>

### Explanation

With the Lock Middleware, if the intent is already locked, it will be returned directly without
calling the handler.

You have to pass at least one of the following parameters to the `createLockMiddleware` function:
- `getLockKey`: a function that takes an envelope and returns a string key (the one that will be used to identify the lock)

Then as a second argument, you can provide the following parameters (and per intent):
- **adapter**: the adapter to use to store the lock (default: `inMemoryLockAdapter`)
- **ttl**: number (default: `500`) - the time to live in milliseconds
- **tick**: number (default: `100`) - the delay between each try to get the lock
- **timeout**: number (default: `1000`) - the maximum time to wait for the lock

## Added Stamps

No stamps are added by this middleware.
