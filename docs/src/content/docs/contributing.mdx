You are on the good page! We need you! Missive.js is an open-source project and we are looking for contributors. You can help us in many ways:
- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting new features
- Writing documentation
- Writing tests
- Fixing bugs
- Implementing new features

Also, you can help us by sharing Missive.js with your friends and colleagues. The more people use Missive.js, the more feedback we get and the better
the project becomes.

We have also never-ending stories:
- coding examples with different frameworks
- build new Middlewares! **The more middleware we have, the more powerful Missive.js becomes!**

> There is also always a need for financial support. If you want to help us financially, you can do so by becoming a sponsor on GitHub or by making a donation on Open Collective.


## How to contribute to the repository?

We are using GitHub to manage the project. You can find the source code there.

<Steps>

1. Fork the repository on Github so you can make changes to your own copy of the repository.

    <LinkButton icon="github" variant="secondary" href="https://github.com/Missive-js/missive.js/fork" iconPlacement='start'>Fork me!</LinkButton>

2. Clone your fork

    ```bash
    git clone YOURFORK
    ```

3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix

    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-feature
    ```
4. Make your changes

5. Commit your changes

    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: this is a new middleware to do something"
    ```

6. Push your changes to your fork

    ```bash
    git push origin my-feature
    ```

7. Create a pull request on GitHub against the `main` branch of the main repository

8. Wait for the review and the merge

9. Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

    And share your contribution to the world!
</Steps>


## We have some toolings and conventions to help streamline the process

Using Makefile, we have some commands to help you:
- `make install` to install the dependencies
- `make tests` to run the tests
- `make build` to build the project
- `make codeclean` to lint & check the project

Also we have targets to run the project in development mode:
- `make serve-docs` to run the documentation site
- `make serve-astro-example` to run the Astro example
- `make serve-nextjs-example` to run the Next.js example
- `make serve-remix-run-example` to run the Remix Run example
- `make serve-cli-example` to run the CLI example

> As you can see, we are missing some obivous examples. You can help us by creating those: Svelte, Vue, Angular, etc.

## Conventions

- We are using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to manage the commits
- We are using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to manage the versions
- We are using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format the code
- We are using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to lint the code
- We are using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) to test the code

> Remember to run `make tests` before pushing your changes to ensure the code is clean, formatted correctly and that the tests are passing.
