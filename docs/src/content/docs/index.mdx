## Why did we build Missive.js?

We love clean architecture and CQRS, we didn't find any simple Service Bus that fits our needs. More details in the [full article](/missive.js/why).

    <Card title="Easy to use" icon="rocket">
        Simple, pragmatic, super lightweight, no magic, just what you need and all Open Source with only 1 (peer)
        dependency (zod).

    <Card title="Agnostic" icon="puzzle">
        You can use it with any framework or library, wether you're fully backend or backend for frontend, we got you
        covered.

    <Card title="Type-safe" icon="seti:typescript">
        Define your `query`, `command` or `event` using a [Zod schema](https://zod.dev) for validation and type
        inference. The `bus` instance is fully typed. _(You'll have auto-completion for free!)_

    <Card title="Middlewares" icon="open-book">
        Can we call it a Service Bus without Middlewares? _(we don't)_. Register middlewares to leverage the full power
        of the service bus.

## In a nutshell

<Steps>

1. Install it

    <Install />

2. Define your handler for `query`, `command` or `event` using a [Zod schema](https://zod.dev) for validation and type inference.

    <CreateHandler />

3. Create a `bus` instance with all your definitions

    <DefineBus />

4. Dispatch an intent

    <Dispatch />

</Steps>

## Built-in Middlewares

Those are the built-in [middlewares](/missive.js/guides/middlewares) that you can use out of the box. They are all optional and you can use them all together or just the ones you need.
Middlewares provides a way to handle cross-cutting concerns. They are key to keep your code clean and maintainable.
And most of all, they are easy to write and to use, and they can be generic!

That's the power of Missive.js! Here are the built-in middlewares <Badge text='coming soon' variant='caution'/>:
