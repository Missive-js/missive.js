## Why did we build Missive.js?

We love clean architecture and CQRS, we didn't find any simple Service Bus that fits our needs. More details in the [full article](/missive.js/why).

        Can we call it a Service Bus without Middlewares? _(we don't)_. Register middlewares to leverage the full power

        We got you covered with built-in middlewares like

</CardGrid>

## In a nutshell

<Steps>

1. Install it

    <Install />

2. Define your handler for `query`, `command` or `event`

    <CreateHandler />

3. Create a `bus` instance with all your definitions

    <DefineBus />

4. Dispatch an intent

    <Dispatch />

</Steps>

## Built-in Middlewares

Whitout Middlewares, a Service Bus is almost useless, we provide built-in [middlewares](/missive.js/guides/middlewares) that you can use out of the box. They are all optional and you can use them all together or just the ones you need.
Middlewares provides a way to handle cross-cutting concerns. They are key to keep your code clean and maintainable.
And most of all, they are easy to write and to use, and they can be generic!

That's the power of Missive.js! Here are the built-in middlewares:

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Validator Middleware" icon="approve-check-circle">
        <p>Validate the intent before it's handled.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/validator'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" title={"Read the doc about the Validator Middleware"}>Read the doc</LinkButton>
    </Card>
    <Card title="Logger Middleware" icon="bars">
        <p>Easily add observability to your application by logging the messages (intent) and the full Envelope (with the Stamps) before and 
        once handled (or errored) in the backend of your choice.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/logger'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" title={"Read the doc about the Logger Middleware"}>Read the doc</LinkButton>
    </Card>
    <Card title="Caching Middleware" icon="open-book">
        <p>Caches results for faster access in future queries, reducing load and making it blazing fast.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/cacher'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" title={"Read the doc about the Cacher Middleware"}>Read the doc</LinkButton>
    </Card>

    <Card title="Retry Middleware" icon="random">
        <p>Automatically retries processing an intent a specified number of times before considering it as failed, with different backoff strategy.</p>

    </Card>
    <Card title="Webhook Middleware" icon="rocket">
        <p> The Webhook Middleware is going to send the envelope(s) to confirured webhook(s) (post processing). It's another powerful way to decouple your system and to make it more resilient or to simply add Observability!.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/webhook'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" title={"Read the doc about the Webhook Middleware"}>Read the doc</LinkButton>
    </Card>

    <Card title="Lock Middleware" icon="seti:lock">
        <p>It provide a way to lock the processing of a message based on something in the intent itself. For instance your could lock the `command` that touches a Cart.</p>

    </Card>

     <Card title="Feature Flag Middleware" icon="seti:yml">
        <p>This middleware ensures that requests are conditionally processed based on the state of feature flags, enabling dynamic feature management, safer rollouts, and efficient A/B testing.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/feature-flag'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" title={"Read the doc about the Feature Flag Middleware"}>Read the doc</LinkButton>
    </Card>

     <Card title="Mock Middleware" icon="seti:purescript">
        <p>This middleware is pretty useful in development mode, to mock the result of a specific intent to bypass the handler.</p>
        <LinkButton href={'/missive.js/built-in-middlewares/mocker'} variant="secondary" class="float-right" title={"Read the doc about the Mocker Middleware"}>Read the doc</LinkButton>
    </Card>

    <Card title="Async Middleware" icon="seti:nunjucks">
        <p>You can already do async if you don't _await_ in your handler, but this is next level to defer handling to a consumer. Push the intent to a queue and handle it asynchronously.</p>
