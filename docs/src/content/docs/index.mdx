## Why did we build Missive.js?

We love clean architecture and CQRS, we didn't find any simple Service Bus that fits our needs. More details in the [full article](/missive.js/why).

<CardGrid stagger>
    <Card title="Easy to use" icon="rocket">
        Simple, pragmatic, super lightweight, no magic, just what you need and all Open Source with only 1 (peer)
        dependency (zod).
    </Card>
    <Card title="Agnostic" icon="puzzle">
        You can use it with any framework or library, wether you're fully backend or backend for frontend, we got you
        covered.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Type-safe" icon="seti:typescript">
        Define your `query`, `command` or `event` using a [Zod schema](https://zod.dev) for validation and type
        inference. The `bus` instance is fully typed. _(You'll have auto-completion for free!)_
    </Card>
    <Card title="Middlewares" icon="open-book">
        Can we call it a Service Bus without Middlewares? _(we don't)_. Register middlewares to leverage the full power
        of the service bus.

    <Card title="Envelopes and Stamps" icon="email">
        Handle cross-cutting concerns with Envelopes and Stamps.

## In a nutshell

<Steps>

1. Install it

    <Install />

2. Define your handler for `query`, `command` or `event` using a [Zod schema](https://zod.dev) for validation and type inference.

    <CreateHandler />

3. Create a `bus` instance with all your definitions

    <DefineBus />

4. Dispatch an intent

    <Dispatch />

</Steps>
